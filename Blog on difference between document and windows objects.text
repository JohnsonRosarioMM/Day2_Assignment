                                Document object vs windows object

Introduction:
    In web development, there are two important objects: the document and the windows.

Document object:

    The document object represents the HTML document itself.
It's like a snapshot of everything you see on a web page.

    It helps you interact with the content of the web page. You canfind elements, change their content, style,
or attribytesm and listen for events like clicks or keystrokes.

    If you want to change the text of a paragraph on your page, 
you'd use the document object to find that paragraph and update its content.

Window object:

    The window object represents the brower window or tab that contains the HTML document.
It's like the frame around the web page.

    It controls things related to the browers itself, not just the content page. You can resize the window,
open new tabs, navigate to different URLs, and manage timming events.

    If you want to open a new browser window when a user clicks a button, you'd use the window object to do that.

Difference:

    Dpcument: Deals with the content and structure of the HTML document intself.
    Window: Deals with the browser environment, controlling things like the size of the window and navigation.

Conclusion:

    These are just basic levels of therotical difference. there are lots in code.
